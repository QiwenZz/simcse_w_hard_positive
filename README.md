## Simple Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings with Hard Positive

This repo is based on SimCSE with the hard positive trick. The code is all from the official SimCSE repo. Only two files are changed to implement the hard positive feature: 1. train.py 2. models.py.

Hard positive is a way to find more meaningful positive pairs that teach the model to learn a better representation based on our research.
